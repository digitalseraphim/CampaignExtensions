Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not spend experience points or gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer's magic arrows only function for her.

Imbue Arrow	KEY:Divine Archer ~ Imbue Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.SpecialQuality.Class Feature.DivineArcher Class Feature	DESC:At 2nd level, an divine archer gains the ability to place a touch spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, a single attack roll is made. If the roll succeeds as a normal attack, both the arrow damage and the spell's effect occur. Otherwise, if the roll succeeds on a touch attack, only the spell effect occurs. This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted.	SOURCEPAGE:p.177
Seeker Arrow	KEY:Divine Archer ~ Seeker Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.SpecialQuality.Class Feature.DivineArcher Class Feature	DEFINE:SeekerArrowTimes|0	DESC:At 4th level, an divine archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners.

This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action). %1/day|SeekerArrowTimes	BONUS:VAR|SeekerArrowTimes|1	SOURCEPAGE:p.177

Arrow of Death	KEY:Divine Archer ~ Arrow of Death	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.SpecialQuality.Class Feature.DivineArcher Class Feature	DESC:At 10th level, an divine archer can create an arrow of death that forces the target, if damaged by the arrow's attack, to make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slain immediately.
