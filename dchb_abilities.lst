Enhance Arrow	KEY:Divine Archer ~ Enhance Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialQuality.Class Feature.DivineArcher Class Feature	DEFINE:ArrowEnhancement|0	DEFINE:ArrowEnhancementLVL|0	DESC:At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an divine archer nocks and lets fly becomes magical, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not spend experience points or gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer's magic arrows only function for her. For every two levels the character advances past 1st level in the prestige class, the magic arrows she creates gain +1 greater potency (+1 at 1st level, +2 at 3rd level, +3 at 5th level, +4 at 7th level, and +5 at 9th level).

Imbue Arrow	KEY:Divine Archer ~ Imbue Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.SpecialQuality.Class Feature.DivineArcher Class Feature	DESC:At 2nd level, an divine archer gains the ability to place a touch spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, a single attack roll is made. If the roll succeeds as a normal attack, both the arrow damage and the spell's effect occur. Otherwise, if the roll succeeds on a touch attack, only the spell effect occurs. This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted.	SOURCEPAGE:p.177
Seeker Arrow	KEY:Divine Archer ~ Seeker Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.SpecialQuality.Class Feature.DivineArcher Class Feature	DEFINE:SeekerArrowTimes|0	DESC:At 4th level, an divine archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow's range prevents the arrow's flight. For example, if the target is within a windowless chamber with the door closed, the arrow cannot enter. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action). %1/day|SeekerArrowTimes	BONUS:VAR|SeekerArrowTimes|1	SOURCEPAGE:p.177
Phase Arrow	KEY:Divine Archer ~ Phase Arrow	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.SpecialQuality.Class Feature.DivineArcher Class Feature	DEFINE:PhaseArrowTimes|0	DESC:At 6th level, an divine archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (A wall of force, a wall of fire, or the like stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, and even armor modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).	DESC:%1/day|PhaseArrowTimes	BONUS:VAR|PhaseArrowTimes|1	SOURCEPAGE:p.177
Hail of Arrows	KEY:Divine Archer ~ Hail of Arrows	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.SpecialQuality.Class Feature.DivineArcher Class Feature	DEFINE:HailArrowsTargets|0	DEFINE:HailArrowsTimes|0	DESC:In lieu of her regular attacks, once per day an divine archer of 8th level or higher can fire an arrow at each and every target within range, to a maximum of one target for every divine archer level she has earned. Each attack uses the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single arrow.

Arrow of Death	KEY:Divine Archer ~ Arrow of Death	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.SpecialQuality.Class Feature.DivineArcher Class Feature	DESC:At 10th level, an divine archer can create an arrow of death that forces the target, if damaged by the arrow's attack, to make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slain immediately. It takes one day to make an arrow of death, and the arrow only functions for the divine archer who created it. The arrow of death lasts no longer than one year, and the archer can only have one such arrow in existence at a time.	SOURCEPAGE:p.177
